# To Do

   * add button to each row to clear the equation
   * add error handling for xyTransform f(x)
   * expand piecewise equation restrictions to work directly with x,y so intermediate equation is not required
   * add PNG save
   * add demo pane to show how the metaballs look while moving
   * add color gradient support
   * do something about a progress bar
   * floats must have preceding 0 in formula evaluation - .9 fails where 0.8 is ok
   * refactor the removal of '=' from equations to the UI layer out of EquationSystem processing
   * refactor error and exception information so they are together
   * Consider implementing a proper package hierarchy to clean up the chaos
   * add shader/filter to threshold the metaballs
   * add error support to x and y pixels
   * fix _saveRequired in EditorView so it properly indicates when save is required
   * add unit tests
   * do a doc pass
